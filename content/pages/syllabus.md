Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this course, but French language concentrators should have taken _21G.028 African Migations_ or have the permission of the instructor.

Course Description
------------------

This course examines contemporary and historical cultural production on and from Africa across a range of registers, including literary, musical, and visual arts, material culture, and science and technology. We employ key theoretical concepts from anthropology and social theory to analyze these forms and phenomena, and historical perspectives help to both situate contemporary cultural production and to interrogate the future directions of African being in the world. Anchoring our discussions in case studies, we consider how Africa’s place in and relationship to the global is articulated through creative practices. The course shows creative cultures and cultural production as not only aesthetic or functional, but also thoroughly political. We explore cases from throughout the continent.

The course is taught in English; French language concentrators have the option to complete additional assignments in French.
